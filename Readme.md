Making a IoT LED dimmer that you can control through your PC, your mobile, tablet or any other device connected to the network is super simple, and I'm going to show you how.

In this project I'm making a three channel LED dimmer that you can use to dim single RGB LED strip or dim three separate LED channels. I want to be able to control lights above my desk and also mix warm white and cool white strip to give me more flexibility over lighting while I'm working, taking pictures or watching movies.

This is going to be a very short and very simple project that if you follow steps below, you can build it in an hour (excluding lead time for components).
